### a. Personas

name: Caithlyn

Gender: female

Age : 20

Occupation: BA student

Problem: Not enough sleep

1. Goal
   •	designed to give you a perfectly timed, energy-reviving 20-60 minute nap.
   •	will be able to recharge their minds after a restful nap in the new sleep pod located on campus

### a. Context Scenarios


Here is Caithlyn’s context scenario:
1.	Caithlyn got to class every mostly late for 5- 10 mins as she didn’t get enough sleep . During the lesson the almost dozed off, the class usually starts at 9 am and ends 12 pm then she had 1 hour gap for her next class.
2.	During that gap usually have lunch for 15 mins then she usually take a nap at the library lounge, sometimes she felt uncomfortable because others student  are looking at her, especially male student.
3.	Caithlyn need to get to her next class but she took the nap little bit longer then usual cause she so tired last night doing her assignment. Caithlyn got into her next class 30 mins late she felt so guilty and left behind a lot for the lesson.
4.	The lesson ends at 3 pm . Caithlyn again had 1 hour gap for the next class. She felt so tired cause her class need to end at 6 pm everyday. Caithlyn again thinking of taking another nap or place where she can think or privacy for the to get her mind clear before the next class. So the only place that she can go is the campus library lounge.
5.	The days goes by slowly Caithlyn get to her next class on time as she didn’t want to left behind.


Notice how the scenario remains at a fairly high level, without getting too specific about interfaces or technologies. It’s important to create scenarios that are within the realm of technical possibility, but at this stage the details of reality are unimportant. We want to leave the door open for truly novel solutions, and it’s always possible to scale back; we are ultimately trying to describe an optimal, yet still feasible, experience. Also notice how the activities in the scenario tie back to Vivien’s goals and try to eliminate as many tasks as possible.
### b. Requirements
Describe necessary capabilities of the product
- Functional and data needs
- user mental models
- design imperatives
- product vision
- business requirements
- technology

## 2. Design Framework
### a. Elements
Deﬁne manifestations of information and functionality
1. Information
	2. form factor
	3. posture
	4. input method

2. functional and data elements
	- information
	- functions
	- mechanisms
	- actions
	- domain object models

### b. Framework
